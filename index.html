  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>I  am a student.Accustomed to being around primrimarily adults.I was always mature for my age.Even for friends often  annoyed me during my adolescent years.I had a lot of people who invested in me,and I excelled in most of many and varied hobbies.In highschool i began to tire of the pressure placed on me by my family and my their high expectations.I gradually stopped my extra-curricular activities,including music and drama to work instead so as to graduate the top of my class.I'm a huge fan of art and drama. Since i was a kid i used to paint and act in the theatre up to date.In highschool i was lucky enough to be awarded best female dancer in my drama group.I  love coding because it is usable art because you cane create something interact with,use and work with.I also love coding because it is a team effort.The one thing that really interest me is that in coding if you can think it,it can be a reality </p>
